The wild animal detection system is a machine learing project which alerts  farmers who cultivate nearby forest areas about animal invasion such as monkeys and squirrels.
It promotes sutainable cultivation while raising awarness about how human's action affected nature's habitat and coexistence among humans and animals.
Problem:
Across rural regions, especially near forest borders, wild animals are frequently driven into farmland due to:

Deforestation

Urban expansion

Habitat fragmentation

Climate-driven resource scarcity

Farmers, in turn, suffer crop loss and often resort to harmful or aggressive measures to protect their livelihoods.

Solution :

Detects animal presence via sound (using MFCC audio features)

Issues real-time alerts when detection exceeds a 90% confidence threshold

Analyzes patterns of animal appearances over time for prediction

Visualizes trends to help farmers understand behavioral patterns (e.g., time of day most likely for visits)
